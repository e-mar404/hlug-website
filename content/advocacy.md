## Gatherings

Advocacy is one of the four pillars of our mission. By letting others know of Linux and how it can help their lives, we hope to gain more Linux users. While Linux has already spread throughout the server room and into the cloud, we seek to help people find new uses of Linux and Linux technology in areas where it can transfer more control back to the user, providing efficient, most-effective, and performant computing at a minimal cost.

Throughout the year we target four Advocacy initiatives. If you are interested in being an ambassador of the Houston Linux User Group and wish to promote the use of Linux to those that might know little about the technology, or might know about the technology but have yet to use it, please sign up for one of our Advocacy Meetings and

These effort involve promoting Linux and the Houston Linux User Group.
They typically involve Linux awareness, group meeting times, and handling general questions about Linux and current popular computing topics. They are a great way to meet new people, and understand the needs of computer users.
