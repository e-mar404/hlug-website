The Houston Linux User Group provides support for Linux people needing assistance with:

- Installing Linux on new hardware.
- Improving or fixing a Linux installation.
- Questions about how Linux works.
- Questions / assistance with Linux security.
- Linux software suggestions.

Members meet to both offer support and ask for it. We generally have a diverse enough group to attempt any problem, and have answered thousands of general use problems (and fixed hundreds of WiFi card issues) over the years.
