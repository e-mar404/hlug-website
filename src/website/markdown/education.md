These meetings involve learning about Linux, and computer related topics.
They typically involve a person giving a presentation, but also extend to

They are a great way to gain exposure to current computing topics, improve

#### Lectures and Presentations

Every week we host a Lecture / Presentation session.  To track the topics,
please follow our calendar.

For information about talks, requesting topics for future talks, or offering

#### Coaching

For those who have an interest in a broad area of Linux, and could use
occasional assistance in pursuing their learning goals, the Houston Linux
Users Group provides coaching services.  These services will have one of
our experienced members track your progress, and provide occasional
assistance when small problems in your self-directed learning falter.

#### One on One Teaching

For those looking for deep knowledge in a specific topic, with a member
helping to direct the learning, a few members provide a directed path
toward achieving their learning goals.  These services are not available
for all topics, and are limited based on member availability.
