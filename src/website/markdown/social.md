### Social Gatherings

These meetings involve eating and drinking in the company of Linux minded people.
The topics rarely stay on Linux proper, but flow with whatever the group is
interested in at the moment.  It's a great way to network with Linux loving peers.

#### Holiday Inn Wednesday Meet Up

> Holiday Inn - Westchase Bar &amp; Grill<br/>
> Wednesdays, 9:15 P.M. to 11:00 P.M. <br/>
> 10609 Westpart Drive, Houston, TX 77042 <br/>
> (713) 532-5400 <br/>

Typically four to eight members drive over to the Holiday Inn after the support
meeting.  If the group is large, we combine tables; otherwise most of us sit at
the bar.

The bar offers food; but, the kitchen closes early.  Since most of the members
have just eaten at the support meeting, few people are hungry.  The mixed drinks
are excellent, and a number of bottled and draft beers are available.

Accommodations for computers are sparse, as there are limited power outlets.  WiFi
is available, just ask a group member for the connection details.
